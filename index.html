            <h2>Hello!</h2>
            <p> My name is Sydney Ewing, a student and emerging digital enthusiast with a passion for photography and
                web development. I'm currently pursuing a degree in Information Systems at the University of Utah, where
                I combine my technical knowledge with artistic flair to create captivating visuals and functional
                websites.

                In my free time, I love capturing moments with my film camera, especially scenes from the outdoors and
                cherished moments with friends and family. My photography adds a personal touch to my creative projects,
                infusing them with warmth and emotion.

                As a web development beginner, I'm navigating the learning curve with enthusiasm and resilience. I'm
                honing my skills in HTML and CSS, building my first website and experimenting with design elements to
                bring my visions to life. I also have experience with Figma and Canva, which I use to design and create
                visually appealing graphics for my projects. While I haven't yet started using JavaScript, I'm eager to
                expand my skillset and integrate dynamic features into my work.

                My journey reflects my commitment to growth and my passion for blending technology with creativity. As I
                continue to learn and refine my craft, my projects are sure to leave a lasting impact.</p>

            <h2> My Work</h2>
            <p>I have had the opportunity to work on a variety of projects that have allowed me to apply my design and
                creative skills. Most notably, I created engaging social media posts for a new mobile application, where
                I focused on delivering visually striking content that effectively communicated the app's features and
                benefits.

                For my coursework, I also took on the task of creating advertisements for a perfume line. This involved
                crafting eye-catching visuals that conveyed the essence of the fragrance and appealed to the target
                audience. Through this project, I honed my ability to blend design aesthetics with marketing strategies.

                Beyond formal projects, I frequently lend my skills to friends and family, who often ask me to create
                collages and other artistic projects for personal or celebratory purposes. I'm always happy to help out
                and use these opportunities to experiment with new design techniques and creative concepts. This
                collaborative work allows me to continuously refine my craft and expand my artistic repertoire.</p>
            <p>In the future, I aspire to add different websites to this list, designing and developing sites that not
                only look great but are also user-friendly and responsive. This goal will enable me to further blend my
                interests in technology and design, while providing me with new challenges and opportunities for growth.
